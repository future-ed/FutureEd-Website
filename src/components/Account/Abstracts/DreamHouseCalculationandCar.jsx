                <p>In this section, we'll discuss the process of calculating the monthly expenses associated with your 
                    dream house and car. We'll explore the various costs involved, from mortgage payments to utilities and
                    maintenance, helping students estimate the financial needs of owning and maintaining their ideal home. 
                    By doing so we can help students set more realistic goals and motivate them to create a clear path to 
                    reach these goals.</p>
